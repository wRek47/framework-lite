# framework-lite

Framework Lite is great for websites and companies that don't need to deal with registered users directly.
Let the other companies take on the liability of protecting your customers information, so you can focus more on showing off (and selling) your products.

Include framework-lite.php into your parent/jailed files and instantly unlock php-based features like determining what page you're on, determining what the default page is, fetching data records, displaying forms, validating input and displaying input results, individual and overall traffic analytics, object-based template management, error management and much more.


This project is in-development and version information will be released after Alpha stage of Framework-Lite.
Check back regularly to see engine progress.
